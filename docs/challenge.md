# Challenge Documentation

This document outlines the changes and improvements made during the process of transcribing the Jupyter Notebook `.ipynb` file to the `model.py` file.

## Improvements and Changes

## 2.Features Generation

### `get_period_day` Function

#### Changes Made

- Adjusted the logic of time period comparisons to avoid misclassification of times that fall exactly on the boundary of a period, such as 05:00.
- Incorporated error handling to accommodate situations where the input cannot be parsed into a datetime object.

#### Justification

- The adjustment in time period comparison logic rectified a bug in the original implementation, which led to certain times being misclassified.
- Error handling was introduced as a good programming practice to prevent function failure with unexpected input data.

### `is_high_season` Function

#### Changes Made

- Refactored the logic to use a list of high season date ranges, reducing code duplication and enhancing readability.
- Integrated error handling to manage instances where the input cannot be parsed into a datetime object.

#### Justification

- The refactoring of date range logic was an enhancement aimed at reducing code duplication and improving readability.
- Error handling was added as a good programming practice to prevent function failure with unexpected input data.

### `get_min_diff` Function

#### Changes Made

- Added error handling to manage instances where the input cannot be parsed into a datetime object.
- Kept the conversion of dates into datetime objects outside of the function to avoid undesired alterations in the original data.

#### Justification

- Error handling was introduced as a good programming practice to prevent function failure with unexpected input data.
- The conversion of data into datetime objects was kept outside of the function to avoid undesired side effects in other parts of the code.

### `calculate_delay` Function

#### Changes Made

- Transformed the original procedure into a function to enhance code reusability and comprehensibility.

#### Justification

- Transforming the procedure into a function is a good programming practice that enhances code reusability and readability.
